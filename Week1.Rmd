# Week 1

Presenter: Genelle Denzin (she/her)
(HMIS Data Analyst, a co-organizer of Columbus R-Ladies)

Collaborators: Ezgi Karaesman, Carolyn Hoffman, Ashley Wynn

## Pre-Course Instructions

Did anyone have problems installing R or RStudio?

## Logistics

When we get past these intro slides and start running some R commands, you can either:

- If you have it installed, open RStudio and follow verbal instructions (you won't need to see my screen, but if you have 2 monitors, great!)
- Follow along visually

## What is R

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project, similar to the S language and environment, developed at Bell Labs in the 1980s.
https://www.r-project.org/about.html

- R has advanced statistical capabilities

- Free and open source

## Why R

![](images/Rlogo.png)

- R was built for data and statistics whereas Python has a broader purpose. (Other languages are capable of manipulating data as well.)

- R is gaining popularity in recent years due to its intentional approach to creating and maintaining a friendly and diverse community around the language.


## Why R for HMIS?

- We need more efficient and reliable ways to shape our data without restrictions. 
- We worry about losing work in legacy systems. 
- Reproducibility
- Free(ish) solution. 
- We want ways of sharing our ideas and code with each other. Each CoC does not need to independently build (or pay for) the same reports and systems to do the same things that are needed at the national level. 

## What is RStudio

- IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Ecosystem for your code

## My Focus Across the Five Weeks

- Syntax intro (but not super deep).
- Workflow as a main focus, as it's something I can give you as a fellow HMIS admin that is not as easy to come by in the multitudes of free (and cheap) R courses and excellent documentation that already exists.
- Can and will adjust over the course of the 5 weeks as needed/requested.

## Ways to Learn R 

- R4DS
- R-Ladies
- Coursera
- Slack #r-learners channel on HMIS Help
- Twitter #rstats
- Tutorial tab in RStudio (learnR package)
- (many others)

# Demo

## Homework (OPTIONAL)

In RStudio in the upper right quadrant, click "Tutorial" tab. Install learnR package. Do one tutorial there.
