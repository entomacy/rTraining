# Week 1

Presenter: Genelle Denzin 

Collaborators: Ezgi Karaesman, Carolyn Hoffman, Ashley Wynn

## Pre-Course Instructions

Did anyone have problems installing R or R Studio?

## Logistics

The next few slides will not be about coding, but when we do get to the slides where we will be running some R commands, you can either:

- If you have it installed, open R Studio and follow verbal instructions (you won't need to see my screen, but if you have 2 monitors, great!)
- Follow along visually

## What is R

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project, similar to the S language and environment, developed at Bell Labs in the 1980s.

## Why R

R & Python are commonly used for data manipulation, and both languages are great for this, but R was built for data and statistics whereas Python has a broader purpose. Other languages are capable of manipulating data as well. R is gaining popularity in recent years due to its intentional approach to creating and maintaining a friendly and diverse community around the language.

## Why R for HMIS?

- We need more efficient and reliable ways to shape our data without restrictions. 
- We worry about losing work in legacy systems. 
- Reproducibility
- We want ways of sharing our ideas and code with each other. 
- Free(ish) solution. Each CoC does not need to independently build (or pay for) the same reports and systems to do the same things that are needed at the national level. 

## What is R Studio

- IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Ecosystem for your code

## My Focus Across the Five Weeks

- Forest view
- Syntax intro (but not super deep).
- Workflow as a main focus, as it's something I can give you as a fellow HMIS admin that is not as easy to come by in the multitudes of free (and cheap) R courses and excellent documentation that already exists.
- Can and will adjust over the course of the 5 weeks as needed/requested.

## Ways to Learn R Besides this Group

- R4DS
- R Ladies
- Coursera
- Slack #r-learners channel on HMIS Help
- Twitter #rstats

## How Does R Work?

If you installed R Studio, go to your Console.

# Demo

## Homework (OPTIONAL)

Put all the Project Type Code values (https://hudhdx.info/VendorResources.aspx download the one named FY2020 HMIS CSV Format Specifications.pdf) in a vector and save that to a variable named PTC (or however you want to abbreviate that). Execute your code in the console.
