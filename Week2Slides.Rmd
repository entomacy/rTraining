## Homework

Feedback on the homework? Was everyone able to get through the Data Basics tutorial?

## Logistics

- Access to two monitors will be ideal.

- Please send questions/comments to the chat or raise your hand if you need to ask a question and I can unmute you. 

- Technical difficulties from Week 1 (this recording should work!)

- Going forward I will be keeping the readme at the GitHub link updated with resources, links to recordings, homework instructions, etc. Please check there for information and contact me directly if you have any questions.

## Settings to Change Now

Tools > Global Settings > General > Workspace > uncheck "Restore .RData into workspace at startup" and set "Save Workspace" to "Never"

Why: You should save code that works every time. Write every script assuming it will be run in a fresh R process. 

A great resource about workflows is https://rstats.wtf (What They Forgot... to teach you)

## History

The commands you submitted last week **are** actually available to you if you do want those.

## Project-based workflows

- Highly recommended as a way to keep your work more reproducible
- Useful as a way of always having a relevant working directory
- Can have multiple projects open simultaneously
- Keep like work together
- Use the here package

## Scripts

How to create
Commenting 
How to write things 
How to run things 
Source script
Saving the script (where?)

## Sessions, workspaces

- ls()
- Restart R
- Clear Environment

## Installing Packages

- run install.packages("dplyr")

## Homework 

- [Install git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) on the same computer that you have R & RStudio on.
- Sign up for a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. (There are other git platforms like GitLab and others- it is ok to choose whichever you want but I am using GitHub and will know more about it.)
- Work with your vendor to try to get access to a HUD CSV Export from your HMIS. (You'll want this in Week 4.) 

## IF YOU ARE SO INCLINED

- Donations to COHHIO's Pandemic Fund  which helps organizations in Ohio keep our homeless neighbors safe from COVID-19. https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/cohhio-pandemic-emergency-fund

- Donations to the Columbus Freedom Fund which bails out local Black Lives Matter protesters can be made here: https://www.paypal.me/columbusfreedomfund
