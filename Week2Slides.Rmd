## Homework

Feedback on the homework? Which tutorial did people take?

## Logistics

- It is highly recommended that you have 2 monitors or an extra laptop on hand. If you do have a way of setting that up between now and the demo, go ahead. If not, it's ok to just do your best or just follow along visually.

- Please send questions/comments to the chat or raise your hand if you need to ask a question and I can unmute you.

## What is RStudio

- IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Ecosystem for your code
