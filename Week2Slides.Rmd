# Week 2: RStudio

Co-presenter: Carolyn Hoffman (fellow R user, Training & Technical Assistance)

## Homework

Feedback on the homework? Was everyone able to get through the Data Basics tutorial?

## Logistics

- Access to two monitors will be ideal.

- Please send questions/comments to the chat or raise your hand if you need to ask a question and I can unmute you. 

- Technical difficulties from Week 1 (this recording should work!)

- Going forward I will be keeping the readme at the GitHub link updated with resources, links to recordings, homework instructions, etc. Please check there for information and contact me directly if you have any questions.

## What is RStudio
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Other examples of IDEs: Vim, Emacs, Visual Studio

## RStudio

We love code because:

1. It's repeatable/reusable 
2. Inspectable (ability to review the work)
3. Diffable (can compare changes over time)

RStudio gives you the space to organize your code, connect to data sources, iterate, share, and back up your code. Makes coding easier.

# Demo

## Homework 

- [Install git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) on the same computer that you have R & RStudio on.
- If you don't already have an account with either GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, go sign up for a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. (It is ok to choose whichever site you want but I will be demoing GitHub because I know more about it.)
- Work with your vendor to try to get access to a HUD CSV Export from your HMIS. If you're not already familiar, please read about this export and download the [specifications](https://hudhdx.info/VendorResources.aspx). (You'll want this in Week 4.) 

## IF YOU ARE SO INCLINED

- Donations to COHHIO: https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-the-coalition-on-homelessness-and-housing-in-ohio

- Donations to the Columbus Freedom Fund which bails out local Black Lives Matter protesters can be made here: https://www.paypal.me/columbusfreedomfund
