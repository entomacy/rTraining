# change RStudio theme so it's easier for people to read

## Add two numbers

15 + 7

# So what? Programming helps with preventing repetition
  
# Assigning a value to a variable

# The assignment arrow means you are adding meaning to that variable 
# name. In RStudio, you can type it with Alt dash.
  
total_days <- 15 + 7

total_days # doesn't return "answer" because no question was asked

# Surround command in () if you want it to return results
# Create variable based on another variable

(days_minus_4 <- total_days - 4)

## Vector: the most basic R data object. Atomic vectors are all of the 
# same data type; lists can have different data types. (A list is a type
# of vector.) The data types are: character, double, interger, logical, 
# complex, and raw.

# We've already created two vectors! Let's see what data type they are.

typeof(total_days)

# typeof() is a function that is native to base R.

# A vector can be made in a number of different ways. The 
# most common is like so:

c(1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 13)  

literally_homeless <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 13)

literally_homeless

# Another way:
  
(project_types <- 1:14)



## Other kinds of vectors

funders <- c("HUD", "VA", "HHS")

















## Include a variable in a vector

# You'll remember we already created a variable called "literally_homeless". 
# Let's see what's in it:

literally_homeless

# What happens if we write something else to "literally_homeless"?

literally_homeless <- c(days_minus_4, total_days, 5, 8)

literally_homeless

# first thing to notice: the vector returns the variable's values

# second thing to notice: literally_homeless has been overwritten!




















## The Order in which you run code

# remember y == 18 because we ran the code (y <- x - 4) when x == 22
# let's say we want to overwrite x with a different value

total_days <- 11

# what is y going to be?

days_minus_4

# how can we make y be x - 4 again?
# (you would write a function to do this, but that's for another time)
days_minus_4 <- total_days - 4

days_minus_4

# it's best to name your variables in a descriptive way and not reuse them in 
# the same analysis!







## Vector Manipulation

total_days * literally_homeless








# Check for truth

total_days == 1

total_days != 1

total_days > 1

total_days >= 1

total_days <= 1


# Exploring data objects

summary(literally_homeless)

# send incomplete command to console (remove second paren)
total_days <- "incomplete"
