# Week 1

Presenter: Genelle Denzin (she/her)
(HMIS Data Analyst, a co-organizer of Columbus R-Ladies)

Collaborators: Ezgi Karaesman, Carolyn Hoffman, Ashley Wynn, Fred Hintz

## Pre-Course Instructions

Did anyone have problems installing R or RStudio?

## Logistics

- It is highly recommended that you have 2 monitors or an extra laptop on hand. If you do have a way of setting that up between now and the demo, go ahead. If not, it's ok to just do your best or just follow along visually.

- Please send questions/comments to the chat or raise your hand if you need to ask a question and I can unmute you.

## My Focus Across the Five Weeks

- Syntax intro (but not super deep).
- Workflow as a main focus, as it's something I can give you as a fellow HMIS admin that is not as easy to come by in the multitudes of free (and cheap) R courses and excellent documentation that already exists.
- Can and will adjust over the course of the 5 weeks as needed/requested.

## What is R

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project, similar to the S language and environment, developed at Bell Labs in the 1980s.

- R has advanced statistical capabilities

- Free and open source

## Why R

![](images/Rlogo.png)

- R was built for data and statistics whereas Python has a broader purpose. (Other languages are capable of manipulating data as well.)

- R is gaining popularity in recent years due to its intentional approach to creating and maintaining a friendly and diverse community around the language.


## Why R for HMIS?

- We need more efficient and reliable ways to shape our data without restrictions. 
- We worry about losing work in legacy systems. 
- Reproducibility
- Free(ish) solution. 
- We want ways of sharing our ideas and code with each other. Each CoC does not need to independently build (or pay for) the same reports and systems to do the same things that are needed at the national level. 

## What is RStudio

- IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Ecosystem for your code

## Ways to Learn R 

- R4DS
- R-Ladies
- Coursera
- Slack #r-learners channel on HMIS Help
- Twitter #rstats
- Tutorial tab in RStudio (learnR package)
- (many others)

# Demo

## Homework (OPTIONAL)

In RStudio in the upper right quadrant, click "Tutorial" tab. Install learnR package. Do one tutorial there.

## Final Instructions from Demo

You can close out RStudio now, but please be aware that all that we did in the console will be lost (and that's ok).

We'll talk more next time about how to save code, etc.
