## Basics of R

### Ways to Learn R

### R communities

[R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) - organization within the R community that aims to empower women to lead in the tech community. Holds meetups all around the world open to all and if thereâ€™s not one near you, you can attend virtual one, though all of them are virtual right now anyway, so.
